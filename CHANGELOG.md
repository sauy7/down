## Additions

* Adds keep_original_filename option so downloaded tempfile uses the original filename

## 2.4.3 (2017-04-06)

* Show the input URL in the `Down::Error` message.

## 2.4.2 (2017-03-28)

* Don't raise `StopIteration` in `Down::ChunkedIO` when `:chunks` is an empty
  Enumerator.

## 2.4.1 (2017-03-23)

* Correctly detect empty filename from `Content-Disposition` header, and
  in this case continue extracting filename from URL.

## 2.4.0 (2017-03-19)

* Allow `Down.open` to accept request headers as options with String keys,
  just like `Down.download` does.

* Decode URI-decoded filenames from the `Content-Disposition` header

* Parse filenames without quotes from the `Content-Disposition` header

## 2.3.8 (2016-11-07)

* Work around `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` responses by downloading whole
  response body.

## 2.3.7 (2016-11-06)

* In `Down.open` send requests using the URI *path* instead of the full URI.

## 2.3.6 (2016-07-26)

* Read #original_filename from the "Content-Disposition" header.

* Extract `Down::ChunkedIO` into a file, so that it can be required separately.

* In `Down.stream` close the IO after reading from it.

## 2.3.5 (2016-07-18)

* Prevent reading the whole response body when the IO returned by `Down.open`
  is closed.

## 2.3.4 (2016-07-14)

* Require `net/http`

## 2.3.3 (2016-06-23)

* Improve `Down::ChunkedIO` (and thus `Down.open`):

  - `#each_chunk` and `#read` now automatically call `:on_close` when all
    chunks were downloaded

  - `#eof?` had incorrect behaviour, where it would return true if
    everything was downloaded, instead only when it's also at the end of
    the file

  - `#close` can now be called multiple times, as the `:on_close` will always
    be called only once

  - end of download is now detected immediately when the last chunk was
    downloaded (as opposed to after trying to read the next one)

## 2.3.2 (2016-06-22)

* Add `Down.open` for IO-like streaming, and deprecate `Down.stream` (janko-m)

* Allow URLs with basic authentication (`http://user:password@example.com`) (janko-m)

## 2.1.0 (2016-04-12)
